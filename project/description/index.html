      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>Our project consists of a genetically modified cyanobacteria that can degrade plastic, specifically PET (PolyEthylene Terephthalate), a plastic most commonly found in water bottles.</p>
      <p>We gained inspiration from our research, the recently discovered bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis has the capability to break down PET by producing the protein PETase (Yoshida, et al. 2016). Our team used the PETase gene and has modified it in order to be expressed and secreted in cyanobacteria. This engineering was accomplished in a dual-host plasmid shuttle vector in E coli, and then transferred to a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus by conjugation. Cyanobacteria, or blue algae, is capable of membrane specific targeting of green fluorescence protein (Spence, Edward, et al. 2003).</p>
      <p>This means that there would be a method of detection to successfully determine the gene transfer. Through an assay of fluorescein present in water, it could be determined that PET would be successfully broken down by the genetically engineered cyanobacteria.</p>

      <h3>Project brainstorming and Reasoning</h3>
      <p>The brainstorming part of our project began in january 14th with our spring team. There were many topics of interest, initially, we were interested in the idea of coming up with a solution to combat plastic pollution in the ocean. As we were searching for specific problems to target, we came across the devastating effects of human action. Just earlier this year, a dead whale washed up on the shore of the Philippines with nearly 90 lbs of plastic in its stomach (Borunda 2019).</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it’s not just ocean life that’s affected by plastic pollution in the ocean. In 2018, National Geographic reported that microplastic was found in human feces (Wüstneck 2018). This means that the plastic pollution created by humans has found it’s way back up to the food chain right back to us.</p>
      <p>The most common type of plastic that is polluted into the ocean is found in the everyday single-use plastic water bottle: PET (Whitaker 2019). PET takes a long time to break down, and once it does, it will turn into small particles, or microplastic, that immensely negatively impact oceanic wildlife and its ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, extensive research into the breakdown of PET has been conducted. In 2016, a team of Japanese scientists at the Kyoto Institute of Technology and the Keio University led by Shosuke Yoshida discovered that the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis is capable of breaking down and consuming PET (Yoshida, Shosuke, et al. 2016).</p>
      <p>With this in mind, we wanted to incorporate this idea into an existing organism that is native to the ocean biome. So, we chose cyanobacteria, specifically S. elongatus, to be genetically modified with the PETase gene from I. sakaiensis. And since cyanobacteria have been found to be capable of membrane specific targeting of green fluorescence protein (Spence, Edward, et al. 2003) utilizing it proves to be more effective for testing and feasible for our team to work with.</p>
